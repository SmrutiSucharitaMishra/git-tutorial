we cannot push directly into owner's repository because it may create  unknown errors or we may not have proper acces to it, thats why we create a xerox
of that owner project on our github account called fork. after clicking on fork 
a new repository with same code as owner gets created in our github, further we need 
that code in our local system in order to make changes into it. and then we clone that xerox repo
into our system. 
cloning process include 
copying the repo link  from green color button in github, then writing 
git clone <copied link> in git bash , where git bash is open in the particular location where we want to clone our project.
we do not need to write git remote add origin command to create connection between our local  system and xerox repo
after "cloning"  as it comes with the connection data itself to our local system.

now three of them 
local system's folder , xerox repository in  our github (forked repo)  and the owner's repository are interconnected.
local system > forked repo >(controlled access)> owner repository.
